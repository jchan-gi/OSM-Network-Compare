# OSM-Network-Compare
This is my bachelor thesis on a general method to compare two GIS networks.   
In the trial study, we compare OSM and reference network in a small region in Hong Kong. 

## Implementation
A anaconda environment with Jupyter Notebook is being used in my study.
Please notice that the script requires packages as described in my thesis.

## Comparison method
* Clustering Coefficient
* Efficiency
* Centralities
etc.

## Repository content
1. One HK1980 Projection shapefile defining the site area. Only OSM data within this region would be downloaded.
2. Two shapefiles, one for edges and one for nodes, of the reference network.
3. The Jupyter Notebook containing the scripts.
4. The thesis of this repository.
